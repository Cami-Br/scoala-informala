            <h1>Adidas</h1>
            Adidas stylized as adidas since 1949) is a German multinational corporation,
            founded and headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany, that designs and
            manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the largest sportswear
            manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike.
            the holding company for the Adidas Group, which consists of the Reebok
            sportswear company, 8.33% of the German football club Bayern München,
            and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas' revenue for
            2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.
            The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house; he was
            joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler
            Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the
            development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events.
            To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a
            previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber.
            Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at
            the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the
            relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas, and Rudolf
            established Puma, which became Adidas' business rival.
            The three stripes are Adidas' identity mark, having being used on the
            company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding,
            which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for
            the equivalent of 1,600 euros and two bottles of whiskey, became so
            successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".

            headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest
            sportswear manufacturer in the world. The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf
            Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the
            company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The
            relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split
            in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Both companies are
            currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
            Puma has been a public company since 1986, listed on the Frankfurt Stock

            As of 2017, Puma SE employs more than 13,000 people worldwide and distributes
            its products in more than 120 countries.
            Following the split from his brother, Rudolf originally registered the newly
            established company as Ruda (derived from Rudolf Dassler, as Adidas was based
            on Adi Dassler), but later changed the name to Puma. Puma's earliest logo
            consisted of a square and beast jumping through a D, which was registered,
            along with the company's name, in 1948. Puma's shoe and clothing designs
            feature the Puma logo and the distinctive "Formstrip" which was introduced
            in 1958.
