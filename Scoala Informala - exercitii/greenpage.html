                <p> What do you think of these? The top quote is an example
                    of writing for the public by an institution funded by Arts Council
                    England (ACE). It’s not selectively quoted; it’s a whole information panel

                <p>What do you think of these? The top quote is an example
                    of writing for the public by an institution funded by Arts Council
                    England (ACE). It’s not selectively quoted; it’s a whole information panel
                    in an exhibition. To an initiated insider with a degree or two in fine art,
                    it described the work on show well.Even so, I had to read it twice
                    and think about what it meant. It seemed unnecessarily complicated, with
                    a dense sentence structure that had to be broken into its component parts.
                    I wondered how it would come across to a visitor who hasn’t done a degree
                    in fine art, or who isn’t a curator or an arts professional? They would probably
                    find it opaque and unlikely to genuinely help them engage with the work.The problem
                    is in the use of language and structure, but also with the use of concepts that are
                    not explained. “Space” – for example – is a very common word when talking about art,
                    but it’s gone from a simple word to an art term loaded with actual and metaphorical
                    meaning. A casual reader might not pick up on this.Similarly, a short sentence
                    explaining minimalism might be a useful reminder for those who are already familiar
                    with it, and a helpful summary for visitors who have never heard of it.

                    <p>This appears in exhibitions of more historical works, usually by men (who are
                        dead, white, male and privileged in life). There will often be details about
                        mous friends, affairs and obscure dinner party guests. Does the average visitor
                        care? No; it’s boring information about people we’ve never heard of and have .

                    <p>Good interpretation matters because there’s such a huge range of artistic practices
                        and concerns being shown in galleries. No one can hope to know and understand
                        everything they see and experience, however well educated they are and however much
                        art they’ve seen. Wall panels, labels and information sheets give viewers an.
